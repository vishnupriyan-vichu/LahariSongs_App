1. Thank you Lord, for saving my soul,
   Thank you Lord, for making me whole;
   Thank you Lord, for giving to me,
   Thine great redemption so full and free.

2. Thank you Lord for this High Calling,
   Thank you Lord for bringing me here;
   Thank you Lord for consecrated,
   Ministry sanctified and divine.
