You're on my right side, You're on my left side;    |
Lord, you go behind me, and before me.              | - 2
You are my Rock,
With your wings you cover me;
It is too wonderful - 2 - I cannot, cannot comprehend.
You are the Word, You are the Way	|
You are the Truth, You are my life	| - 2
You're my redemption
You are my joy, my praise, my song;
Your precious blood - 2 - It washed me pure and white.
You are my Shepherd, You're my Redeemer	|
You are my King, You are my Lord	| - 2
You poured your beauty,
You poured your glory out on me;
Nothing can separate - 2 - me from Your love and grace.
