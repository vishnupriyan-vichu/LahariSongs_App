65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBb
Someone came down and lifted me,
Someone whose hand was strong;
Lifted me out of the pit of sin,
Filling, filling me with a song;
Someone came down and lifted me,
Someone whose love was true;
Someone whose name is the sweetest I know,
Someone whose blood washes whiter than snow;
Someone, Christ Jesus my redeemer,
Whose love will carry me through.
