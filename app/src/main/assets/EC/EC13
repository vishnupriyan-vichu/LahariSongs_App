13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tG
He's able, He's able - I know my Lord is able	|
I know my Lord is able to carry me through      | - 2
He heals the broken hearted,
He sets the captives free;
He makes the lame to walk again,
And He makes the blind to see;
For He is able, He is able - I know my Lord is able
I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
