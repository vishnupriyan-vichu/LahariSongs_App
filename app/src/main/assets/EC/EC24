1. I know the Lord will make a way for me - 2
   Just believe, and don't despair;
   God will watch, and He will care;
   I know the Lord will make a way for me.

2. I know the Lord will make a way for you - 2
   Just believe, and don't despair;
   God will watch, and He will care;
   I know the Lord will make a way for you.
