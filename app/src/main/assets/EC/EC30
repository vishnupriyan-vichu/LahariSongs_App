1. I've got a home in Glory land,	|
   That outshines the sun!          | - 3
   Way beyond the blue.

   \tDo Lord, oh do Lord, oh do remember me - 2
   \tHallelujah
   \tDo Lord, oh do Lord, oh do remember me
   \tWay beyond the blue.

2. Christ Jesus is my redeemer, |
   You take Him too!            | - 3
   While He's calling you.

3. The Lord is my shepherd,	|
   I shall not want!		| - 3
   Look away beyond the blue.
