Surely goodness and mercy shall follow follow me,   |
All the days, all the days of my life;              | - 2
And I shall dwell in the house of my Lord forever;
And I shall feast at the table spread for me.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow follow me,   |
All the days, all the days of my life.              | - 2
