It's a highway to heaven,
None can walk up there, but the pure in heart
It's a highway to heaven,
Walking up the King's highway.

There's joy in knowing, with Him we're going,
Walking up the King's highway;
My loads are lighter, our pathway brighter,
Walking up the King's highway.

If you're not walking, start while we're talking,
Walking up the King's highway;
There'll be a blessing, You'll be possessing,
Walking up the King's highway;

Hallelujah, I'm walking with the King,
Praise His holy Name, I'm walking with the King,
Hallelujah, I'm walking with the King,
Everyday I am walking with the King.
