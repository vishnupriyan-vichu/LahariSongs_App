59\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF
Paul and Silas singing Hallelujah,
Paul and Silas in the prison cell;
Paul and Silas singing Hallelujah,
Paul and Silas, all was well;
Paul and Silas singing Hallelujah,
Paul and Silas let the chorus swell;
What's the secret of their Hallelujah?
Paul and Silas and the Lord as well!
