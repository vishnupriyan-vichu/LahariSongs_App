Lift every voice and sing,
Let the heavens praise His new Name;
All sing with harmony, through eternity.
Sing unto Him a new song,
sing praises loud and strong;
Let us march on, now the victory is won!
Sing a song,
Full of the joy that comes
In the morning;
Sing a song,
Sing of our God who is
Now on the throne;
Sing of a glorious day!
He has been caught away!
May the bride march on, now the victory is won!
