Song 45
1. There is a land that is fairer than day,
   And by faith we can see it afar;
   For the Father waits over the way,
   He's prepared us a dwelling place there.

   \tIn the sweet by and by,			|
   \tWe shall meet on that beautiful shore.	| - 2

2. We shall sing on that beautiful shore,
   The melodious song of the Lamb;
   And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
   Not a sign, for the blessing of rest.

3. To our bountiful Father above,
   Sacrifices of love we would give;
   For the glorious gift of His love,
   And the blessings that hallow our days.

4. Let us bless our holy Lord God,
   Let the Heavens be glad and rejoice!
   For the marvellous things He hath done
   For His own, join in joyful song.
