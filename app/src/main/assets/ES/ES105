Song 105
1. We'll walk hand in hand - 2
   We'll walk hand in hand with our Bridegroom;
   Oh, oh deep in my heart, I do believe,
   We'll walk hand in hand with Him.

2. Christ has come to take His Bride - 2
   Christ has come to take His Bride away;
   Oh, oh deep in my heart, I do believe,
   Christ has come to take His Bride away.

3. The thunders are revealed - 2
   The thunders are revealed by the Son of man;
   Oh, oh deep in my heart, I do believe,
   The thunders are being revealed.

4. The Tree of life has come - 2
   The Tree of life has come within our reach;
   Oh, oh deep in my heart, I do believe,
   The Tree of life has come to our reach.
