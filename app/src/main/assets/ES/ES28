Song 28
1. Once Jeremiah the Prophet
   Told of a wonderful day.
   Saw joy and gladness abounding,
   And sorrows all flee away.
   
   \tDwelling among us,
   \tO how the joybells now ring,
   \tHis mercy endureth forever,
   \tAnd of His goodness we sing.

2. He heard the voice of the Bridegroom,
   Speaking from out of the Throne.
   Heard the sweet voice of the Bride sing,
   As God did make her His own.

3. He saw the Bride praise Him forever,
   When as a Bridegroom He came.
   His mercy endureth forever,
   The Lord of Hosts is His Name.

4. No man was found in that city,
   And no wild beast under the tree.
   Only the Bride with the Bridegroom,
   All this the Prophet did see.

5. His speech like the raindrops of Heaven,
   Telling Redemption is nigh.
   His mercy endureth forever,
   A rainbow appears in the sky.

6. His voice will speak in the morning,
   All of the ransomed here bring.
   Then Jeremiah the Prophet,
   Will from the dust rise and sing.

   \tMorning Eternal
   \tBreaking upon us today.
   \tHis mercy endureth forever,
   \tSorrows now all flee away.
