Song 14
1. Down from His glory, ever living story,
   My God and Redeemer came, Christ Jesus is His name,
   Born in simplicity, to His own a stranger,
   A man of sorrows, tears and agony.

   \tOh! how I love Him, how I adore Him,
   \tMy breath, my sunshine, my all in all.
   \tThe great Creator became my Saviour,
   \tAnd all God's fullness dwells in Him.

2. What condensation, bringing us redemption,
   That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight,
   God gracious, tender, laid aside His splendour,
   Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.
