Song 33
1. How great is our God - How great is His word,
   He's the greatest one, that ever was heard.
   He rolled back the waters of the mighty Red sea;
   And He said, "I will lead you, Put your trust in Me."

2. How great is our God - How great is His Name.
   Unchanging is He; everyday He's the same.
   He speaks in the thunder; in the clouds He's revealed.
   And He says, "I'm your Bridegroom,
   And you're My Bride that's sealed."

3. How great is our God - How great is His power!
   He pours out His grace to the Bride in this hour,
   He anoints her with blessings, and bestows on her love,
   For God, by His Spirit, has come down from above.
