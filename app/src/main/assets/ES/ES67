Song 67
1. I've reached the land of corn and wine,
   And all the riches freely mine;
   Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
   For all my night has passed away.
   
   \tO Beulah land, sweet Beulah land,
   \tAs on thy highest mount I stand;
   \tI look away across the sea,
   \tWhere mansions are prepared for me,
   \tAnd view the shining glory shore,
   \tMy heaven, my home forevermore.

2. My Lord has come and walks with me,
   And sweet communion here have we;
   He gently leads me by the hand,
   For this is Heaven's border land.

3. A sweet perfume upon the breeze,
   Is borne from ever vernal trees;
   And flowers, that never fading grow,
   Where streams of life forever flow.

4. The zephyrs seem to float to me,
   Sweet sounds of Heaven's melody;
   As angels with the white-robed throng
   Join in the sweet redemption song.
