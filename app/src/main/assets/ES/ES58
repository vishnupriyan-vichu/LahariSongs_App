Song 58
1. What a fellowship, what a joy is mine,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.
   What a blessedness, what a peace of mind,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.

   \tLeaning - 2, safe and secure from all alarm,
   \tLeaning - 2, leaning on the everlasting arms.
   
2. O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms,
   O how bright the path flows from day to day,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.

3. What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms,
   I have blessed peace, with my Lord so near,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.
