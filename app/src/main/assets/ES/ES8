Song 8
1. Blessed blessed Christ our Lord and King!
   May we praise Thee through eternity;
   Glory honour be unto Thy Name,
   Now and forevermore.
   
   \tWe hail Thee, we hail Thee!
   \tBlessed King of Heaven glorified;
   \tHail Thee, we hail Thee!
   \tAccept our praises now.
   
2. All the hosts of Heaven praise Thee!
   Kneeling singing glory be to Thee;
   All the mankind join in praising Thee,
   Thou art the King of kings.		- We hail Thee...
   
3. O that conquered sin and death and hell!
   May Thy spirit reign over us;
   We will conquer in the New Name;
   Forever we will live.		- We hail Thee...
