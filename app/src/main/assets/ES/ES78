Song 78
1. Praise my soul the King of Heaven;
   To His feet thy tribute bring.
   Ransomed, healed restored forgiven;
   Who like Thee His praise should sing.
   Praise Him, praise Him -2 Praise the everlasting King.

2. Praise Him for His grace and favour;
   To our fathers in distress.
   Praise Him still the same forever;
   Slow to chide and swift to bless.
   Praise Him, praise Him - 2 Glorious in His faithfulness.

3. Fatherlike He tends and spares us;
   Well our feeble frame He knows.
   In His hands He gently bears us;
   Rescues us from all our foes.
   Praise Him, praise Him - 2 Widely yet His mercy flows.

4. Angels help us to adore Him;
   Ye behold Him face to face.
   Sun and moon bow down before Him;
   Dwellers all in time and space.
   Praise Him, praise Him - 2 Praise with us the God of grace.
