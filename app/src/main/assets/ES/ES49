Song 49
1. I've a home prepared - where the saints abide
   Just over in glory land - And I long to be
   By my saviour's side - Just over in glory land.
   
Ch. Just over in the glory land, I'll join the happy angel's band
    Over in the glory land.
    Just over in the glory land, there with the mighty host I'll stand,
    Over in the glory land.
    
2. I am on my way - To those mansions fair
   Just over in the glory land; There to sing God's praise
   And His glory share - Just over in the glory land.

3. What a joyful thought - That my Lord I'll see
   Just over in glory land - And with kindred saved
   There forever be - Just over in glory land.

4. With the blood washed throng - I will shout and sing
   Just over in glory land - Glad hosannas to Christ
   The Lord and King - Just over in glory land.
