Song 76
1. Praise be to Christ Jesus, my redeemer;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, the King of kings;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, life eternal;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, almighty God.

   \tHallelujah Hosanna, Hallelujah - 2
   \tHallelujah Hosanna, Hallelujah - 2

2. Praise be to Christ Jesus, unchanging God;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, my consolation;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, King of Heaven;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, God of the earth. - Hallelujah

3. Praise be to Christ Jesus, my beloved;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, friend in distress;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, mighty healer;
   Praise be to Christ Jesus, light of my path. - Hallelujah

4. Flesh and the devil and vanity,
   Shall be destroyed through the power in His name;
   Sickness and curse and all misery,
   Mighty New Name will certainly tread. - Hallelujah

5. Christ Jesus conquered Satan by His death;
   Chose us as the Bride through the Supreme Sacrifice;
   Made us His vessels of glory and honour;
   Gave us eternal life without death. - Hallelujah
