Song 30
1. Holy Holy Holy, Lord God Almighty;
   Everyday and every hour
   Our song shall rise to Thee;
   Holy Holy Holy, Merciful and mighty
   Our blessed Bridegroom - Through eternity.
   
2. Holy Holy Holy, All the saints adore Thee;
   Casting down their golden crowns
   Around the glassy sea;
   Cherubim and Seraphim, falling down before Thee;
   Which wert and art and evermore shalt be.
   
3. Holy Holy Holy, Though the darkness hide Thee;
   Though the eye of sinful man
   Thy glory may not see;
   Only Thou art Holy, There is none beside Thee;
   Perfect in power, In love and purity.
   
4. Holy Holy Holy, Lord God almighty;
   All Thy works shall praise Thy Name
   In earth and sky and sea;
   Holy Holy Holy, Merciful and mighty;
   Light of all ages, we praise and worship Thee.
