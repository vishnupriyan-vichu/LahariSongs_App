Song 74
1. Our hearts can sing when we pause to remember,
   A heartache here is just a stepping stone.
   Along the trail that's winding always upward,
   This troubled world is not our final Home.
   
   \tBut until then our hearts will go on singing.
   \tUntil then with joy we'll carry on.
   \tUntil the day our eyes behold that city,
   \tUntil the day God calls us Home.

2. The things of earth have dimmed and lost their value,
   If we recall they're borrowed for a while,
   And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
   Remember, we say: 'Twill only be a while.
   
3. This weary world with all its toil and trouble,
   May take its course of misery and strife,
   The soul of man is like a waiting eagle,
   When it's released, it soars into the sky.

4. The Bride awaits with great anticipation,
   To fly away to realms unknown to her,
   And be with Him who fills her with His glory,
   And live with Him throughout eternity.
