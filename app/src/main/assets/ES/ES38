Song 38
1. Like a babe when it cries for its mother,
   Like a child I was helpless alone.
   Then I met the Master,
   Now I am one of His own.

   \tFor all things have changed since He found me;
   \tAnd a new day breaks forth all around me,
   \tFor I met the Master,
   \tAnd I belong to Him.

2. Like a blind man who gropes in the darkness,
   I was lost and away from my Lord;
   Then I met the Master,
   Now I belong to Him.

3. Like a bird on the wing at the dawning,
   My soul takes its flight up above,
   Then I meet the Master,
   And I am filled with His love.

4. Like a Bride who's adorned for her husband,
   'Neath His blood He has made me His own.
   For I've met the Master,
   No more will I walk all alone.

5. Like a butterfly changed in His likeness,
   I leave this cocoon for the sky.
   For I've met the Master,
   And with Him to glory I'll fly.
