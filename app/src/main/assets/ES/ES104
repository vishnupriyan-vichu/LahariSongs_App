Song 104
1. We were there before the foundation	|
   Of the world, we were there		| - 2
   Oh listen! Our hearts are truly rejoicing - 3
   We were there before the foundation
   Of the world, we were there!

2. We were there with the beginning	|
   And the end, we were there		| - 2
   Oh listen! Our hearts are truly rejoicing - 3
   We were there with the beginning
   And the end, we were there!

3. Now we are gathered with our Lord God	|
   Around the throne, we are here		| - 2
   Oh listen! You can hear the angels singing - 3
   Now we are gathered with our Lord God
   Around the throne, we are here!
