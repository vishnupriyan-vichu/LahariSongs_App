Song 65 (New wine)
1. In Canaan town, at a wedding feast,
   One day long years gone by;
   The Son of Man sat down to eat,
   But He was in disguise.

   They all partook of meat prepared,
   His mother and the rest;
   But in the midst of food so good,
   They were of wine bereft.

2. The hour came and the Son of Man
   Bid them cost all reason down;
   Then they drank the wine by Him prepared,
   The best they'd ever found.

   We ate the food the Prophet gave,
   We knew it was the Word;
   We waited in the Son and prayed,
   And lingered with the Lord.

3. But like as in the days of yore,
   When out of wine they ran;
   We longed to feel the joy of God,
   See Him reveal His hand.
   
   And so it was the Son of Man,
   To us new Wine has given;
   The joy we now cannot contain,
   Since He has come from Heaven.

4. A little man from out the East,
   Like lightning to the West;
   Provided us with this New Wine,
   It is indeed the best.

   We thank the Lord we saw the flash,
   And know that soon we'll be;
   Forever with the Lord we love,
   And His face we will see.
