Song 56
1. I am weak but Thou art strong,
   Lord God keep me from all wrong;
   I'll be satisfied as long,
   As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

   \tJust a closer walk with Thee,
   \tGrant it Lord God, is my plea.
   \tDaily walking close to Thee,
   \tLet it be dear Lord, let it be.

2. Thru' this world of toil and snares,
   If I falter Lord who cares?
   Who with me my burden shares?
   None but Thee dear Lord, none but Thee.

3. When my feeble life is o'er,
   Time for me will be no more.
   Guide me gently, safely o'er,
   To Thy Kingdom shore, to Thy shores.
