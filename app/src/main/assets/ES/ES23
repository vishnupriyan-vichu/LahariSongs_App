Song 23
1. Have Thine own way Lord, have Thine own way;
   Thou art the potter, I am the clay;
   Mould me and make me after Thy will;
   While I am waiting, yielded and still.

2. Have Thine own way Lord, have Thine own way;
   Search me and try me, Master today;
   Whiter than snow Lord, wash me just now;
   As in Thy presence, humbly I bow.

3. Have Thine own way Lord, have Thine own way;
   Wounded and weary, help me I pray;
   Power all power, surely is Thine;
   Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine.

4. Have Thine own way Lord, have Thine own way;
   Hold o'er my being absolute sway;
   Fill with Thy spirit, till all shall see;
   Christ only always living in me.
