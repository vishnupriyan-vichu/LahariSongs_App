Song 66
1. There is no God but our Lord Christ Jesus,
   No not one, no not one,
   None else could heal all our soul's diseases,
   No not one, no not one.
   
   \tJesus knows all about our trials,
   \tHe will guide till the work is done,
   \tThere is no God like our Lord Christ Jesus,
   \tNo not one, no not one.

2. There's not a moment when He's not near us,
   No not one, no not one.
   No night so dark that His love can't cheer us,
   No not one, no not one.
