Song 59
1. Lord our God we adore thee;
   Lord we praise thy almighty power.
   Thy whole creation praiseth thee,
   We admire thy wondrous deeds.
   As thou wast in times gone by,
   Thou wilt be eternally.

2. All creation join and praise,
   Cherubims and Seraphims.
   In adoration sing to thee,
   All angels serving thee.
   Shout with joy and blessed peace,
   Holy, holy, holy thou art.

3. Let thy mercy be on thy people,
   Ever help us and ever bless us.
   Lead us kindly in thy way,
   Let the evil one not deceive us.
   May in glory we behold
   Thy blessed face for ever more.

4. Lord God let thy mercy flow,
   Let thy blessings be upon us.
   Let thy goodness be seen today,
   All for the sake of thy living promises.
   Ever we do trust in thee,
   Source of life so full and free.
