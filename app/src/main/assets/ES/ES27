Song 27
1. Sound of His trumpet, thrilling with rapture
   Ushered the Bridegroom to us again;
   All through the ages, patiently waited,
   Some are now sleeping, others remain.

   \tHeavenly Bridegroom! Heavenly Bridegroom!
   \tWelcome my Saviour, hail Thee my king!
   \tHallelujah! I am rejoicing,
   \tSinging I go like birds on the wing.

2. Just like a thief Thou camest for treasure
   Saints from the earth transported shall be;
   Angels from Heaven muster with trumpets,
   Echoing anthem sweetly of Thee.

3. Radiant with glory, Luminous sweet star
   Fairer than morning, lovable He;
   Higher than Heavens, honoured by Father
   This is the Lamb slain, even for me.

4. Saints who are sleeping rise in a twinkling
   Rising immortal caught up to Thee,
   Oh! What a gathering! Some from all nations,
   Meeting Christ Jesus in secrecy.

5. There up in Heaven Saints for enthroning
   Eagerly angels wait for that day;
   Bride in her garments, radiant fine linen,
   Honoured by Saviour, this is her day.
