Song 31
1. O the house of Judah gathered together
   Upon a holy mountain so high.
   And Jehovah came down and spoke to them,
   And to Him they did reply.

   \tPraise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good,
   \tFor His mercy endureth forever,
   \tO Hallelujah there is victory,
   \tIn the Supreme Sacrifice.

2. We are the bride of Christ and the house of Judah,
   And David's Son is our King,
   We have overcome death with victory,
   And this is the song we sing.

3. From the house of Judah came the Son of Man,
   He called out His people one day.
   God spoke thru' Him and He pulled His chosen people
   And this is what they say.

4. Upon mount Zion dwells the House of Judah,
   A people who are led by the Lord.
   They praise and sing with a heart of gladness,
   And the Word of God is their sword.

5. Now the daughters of Zion is the house of Judah,
   A people who stand on the Word.
   They live by the book and serve by His spirit,
   Throughout the land this song is heard.

6. When the house of Judah was in Babylon,
   Their enemies compelled them to sing.
   But they hung their harps on a willow tree,
   And no song were they able to bring.

7. O the Lord our God, reigns in the house of Judah,
   His habitation is in mount Zion.
   O we praise and sing to the Name of our King,
   Christ Jesus' blood is our ensign.

8. O the house of Judah offered sacrifice,
   And God came down from above.
   He accepted the blood of the Lamb that was slain;
   It was a token of His love.
