Song 87
1. Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
   Through eternal ages let His praises ring,
   Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
   Standing on the promises of God.

   \tStanding, standing,
   \tStanding on the promises of my Redeemer
   \tStanding, standing,
   \tI'm standing on the promises of God.

2. Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
   When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
   By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
   Standing on the promises of God. - Standing

3. Standing on the promises I now can see,
   Perfect, present, cleansing is the blood for me,
   Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
   Standing on the promises of God. - Standing

4. Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
   Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
   Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
   Standing on the promises of God. - Standing

5. Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
   Listening every moment to the Spirit's call,
   Resting in my Bridegroom as my all in all,
   Standing on the promises of God. - Standing
