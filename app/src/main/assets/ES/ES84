Song 84
1. Search me O God, and know my heart today;
   Try me O Saviour, and know my thoughts I pray;
   See if there be some wicked ways in me;
   Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.

2. I praise thee Lord, for cleansing me from sin;
   Fulfil thy word and, make me pure within;
   Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame;
   Grant my desire to magnify Thy Name.

3. Lord take my life, and make it wholly thine;
   Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine;
   Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
   I now surrender Lord in Thee abide.
