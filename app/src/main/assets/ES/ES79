Song 79
1. Praise the Lord His glories show, Hallelujah;
   Saints within His courts above, Hallelujah;
   Angels round His Throne above, Hallelujah;
   All that see and share His love, Hallelujah.

2. Praise the Lord for the Lord is good, Hallelujah;
   For His mercy endureth forever, Hallelujah;
   Tell His wonders, sing His truth, Hallelujah;
   Praise Him, praise Him evermore, Hallelujah.

3. Praise the Lord His mercies trace, Hallelujah;
   Praise His providence and grace, Hallelujah;
   All that He for the Bride hath done, Hallelujah;
   All He sends us through His Son, Hallelujah.

4. Strings and voices, hands and hearts, Hallelujah;
   In the throng O bear your parts, Hallelujah;
   All that breathe, your Lord adore, Hallelujah;
   Praise Him, praise Him evermore, Hallelujah.
