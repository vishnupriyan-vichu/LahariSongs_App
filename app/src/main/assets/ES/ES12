Song 12
1. When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,
   When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost;
   Count your many blessings, name them one by one;
   And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.

   \tCount your blessings, name them one by one;
   \tCount your blessings, see what God hath done;
   \tCount your blessings, name them one by one;
   \tCount your many blessings, see what God hath done.

2. Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
   Does the Cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
   Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly;
   And you will be singing as the days go by.

3. When you look at others with their lands and gold,
   Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;
   Count your many blessings, money cannot buy;
   Your reward in Heaven nor your Home on high.

4. So amid the conflict, whether great or small;
   Do not be discouraged, God is over all;
   Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
   Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.
