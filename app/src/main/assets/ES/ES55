Song 55
1. Judgement day will soon be comin',
   Judgement day is near.
   Are you ready for the message,
   That you're gonna hear?
   All the bells will soon be ringing, calling you to rise.
   You'll see everything about you,
   With quite different eyes.
   
   \tTo the right - to the left,
   \tThey will take their position;
   \tAnd you will be there too.
   \tTo the right, to the left, which will be your position?
   \tIt all depends on you.

2. Judgement day will see you gather,
   Round the holy throne;
   Not a soul will be forgotten,
   Not a soul will stay alone.
   They'll rejoice and they'll be troubled,
   And you'll be standing there;
   And the singing of the angels, soon will fill the air.
   As the rich and the poor
   Will be led to each other,
   The difference you will see.
   Everyone who was good will be everyone's brother,
   That's how it's gonna be.
