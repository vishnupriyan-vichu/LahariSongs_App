Song 21
1. Great is Thy faithfulness, God my Redeemer,
   There is no shadow of turning with Thee.
   Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not,
   As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.

   \tGreat is Thy faithfulness - 2
   \tMorning by morning new mercies I see.
   \tAll I have needed Thy hand hath provided,
   \tGreat is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.

2. Summer and winter and spring time and harvest,
   Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
   Join with all nature in manifold witness,
   To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

3. Pardon for sin, and a peace that endureth,
   Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide,
   Strength for today and bright hopes for tomorrow,
   Blessings all mine, with ten thousands beside.
