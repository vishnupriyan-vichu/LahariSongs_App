Song 94
1. There are some things I may not know,
   There are some places I can't go;
   But I am sure of this one thing,
   My God is real, for I can feel Him deep in my soul.

   \tMy God is real, He's real in my soul,
   \tMy God is real, for He has washed and made me whole;
   \tHis love for me is like pure gold,
   \tMy God is real, for I can feel Him deep in my soul.

2. I cannot tell just how it felt,
   When God revealed His love to me;
   But since that day, yes since that hour,
   God has been real, for I can feel His holy power.
