Song 100
1. Thine oh Lord God is the greatness,
   The power and the glory;
   The victory and the majesty,
   Heaven and earth belong to Thee; All Thine, O Lord God.

   \tWe thank Thee and praise Thy glorious name!
   \tHeaven and earth are full of Thee,
   \tThe hosts of heaven are praising Thee,
   \tLord God most high.
   \tWe thank Thee and praise Thy glorious name!

2. Lord God of Sabbath we come to Thee,
   Worshipping in the beauty of holiness;
   Reverently we kneel before Thee,
   Lovingly we look to Thee, Our one and only Lord God.
