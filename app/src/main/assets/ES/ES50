Song 50
1. I've been down into the deepest valley,
   I've been up to heights delights to see;
   But nowhere could I find
   This thing called peace of mind;
   Life is just a prison house to me.
   
   \tBut now I'm so glad Christ Jesus found me,
   \tAnd everyday He whispers to me:
   \t'I didn't have to die,
   \tBut I loved you didn't I?'
   \tHallelujah, Christ has set me free!

2. I had friends who left me when in trouble,
   I didn't know that life to be so cruel;
   But one by one I found,
   They only let me down;
   Life is just a prison for a fool. - But now

3. Outside the prison walls there's lots of people,
   Seized to sin and seized to Satan too;
   They tell themselves they're free,
   But oh they just can't see;
   Life is just a prison for a fool. - But now
