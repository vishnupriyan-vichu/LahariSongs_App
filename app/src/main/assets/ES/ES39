Song 39
1. I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord,
   No tender voice, like Thine can peace afford.

   \tI need Thee, O I need Thee,
   \tEvery hour I need Thee.
   \tO bless me now my Saviour,
   \tI come to Thee.

2. I need Thee every hour, stay Thou near by,
   Temptations lose their power, when Thou art nigh.

3. I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain,
   Come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

4. I need Thee every hour, Thy will alone prevail,
   I hold on to Thy word, Thy promises are mine.

5. I need Thee every hour, Most Holy One.
   You've made me Thine indeed, My blessed Lord and King.
