Song 77
1. Praise Him, praise Him, Christ Jesus our blessed redeemer
   Sing O earth His wonderful love proclaim.
   Hail Him, hail Him, highest archangels in glory;
   Strength and honour give to His Holy Name.

   Like a shepherd Jesus will guard His children;
   In His arms He carries them all day long.
   Praise Him, praise Him, tell of His excellent greatness;
   Praise Him, praise Him ever in joyful song.

2. Praise Him, praise Him - Christ Jesus our blessed redeemer;
   For our sins He suffered and bled and died.
   He our Rock our hope of eternal redemption;
   Hail Him, hail Him, Christ Jesus the King of kings.

   Sound His praises for freeing us from our sorrows;
   Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong.
   Praise Him, praise Him, tell of His excellent greatness;
   Praise Him, praise Him, ever in joyful song.

3. Praise Him, praise Him, Christ Jesus our blessed redeemer;
   Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring.
   He our Bridegroom reigneth forever and ever;
   Crown Him, crown Him, prophet and priest and king.

   Christ is ruling over the world victorious;
   Power and glory unto the Lord belong.
   Praise Him, praise Him, tell of His excellent greatness;
   Praise Him, praise Him, ever in joyful song.
