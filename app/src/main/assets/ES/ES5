Song 5
1. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound;
   That saved a wretch like me.
   I once was lost, but now I'm found;
   Was blind, but now I see.
   
2. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear;
   And grace my fears relieved.
   How precious did that grace appear
   The hour I first believed.
   
3. Through many dangers toils and snares
   I have already come;
   'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far;
   And grace will lead me home.

4. When we've been there ten thousand years,
   Bright shining as the sun;
   We've no less days to sing God's praise
   Than when we first began.

5. Praise God, praise God, praise God, praise God
   Praise God, praise God, praise God,
   Praise God, praise God, praise God, praise God
   Praise God, praise God, praise God.
