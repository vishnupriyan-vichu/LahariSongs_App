Song 51
1. I've been trav'ling here in this life,
   With its heartaches, trouble and strife,
   Sometimes Satan tries to tell me to turn aside, aside;
   I say, 'Satan get thee behind,
   No returning in me you'll find.
   I'm too near my heavenly home where I'll abide.'
   
   \tI'm too near to home with my Lord,
   \tToo near home and heaven's reward,
   \tI am not returning to sin, I have made my vow;
   \tThere is nothing now to go back to,
   \tPraise the Lord, sweet heaven's in view,
   \tI'm too near my heavenly home to turn back now.

2. There is joy in going this way,
   It gets sweeter every day,
   The Son of Man is leading the way to realms above, above;
   He'll be with us until the end,
   Be our Leader, Guide and our Friend;
   I'll arrive in heaven the home of perfect love.

3. Just one glimpse inside the home gate,
   See the friends and loved ones who wait,
   Will be worth whatever the cost, to make it thro', it thro',
   I would not give up in the race,
   I'll continue by the Lord's grace;
   I'm too near that wonderful home beyond the Blue.
