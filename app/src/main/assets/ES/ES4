Song 4
1. All to Jesus I surrender;
   All to Him I freely give.
   I will ever love and trust Him;
   In His presence daily live.
   
   \tI surrender all, I surrender all;
   \tAll to Thee my blessed Saviour,
   \tI surrender all.
   
2. All to Jesus I surrender;
   Humbly at His feet I bow.
   Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
   Take me Jesus take me now.		- I surrender all.....
   
3. All to Jesus I surrender;
   Make me Saviour wholly Thine.
   Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
   Truly know that Thou art mine.	- I surrender all.....
