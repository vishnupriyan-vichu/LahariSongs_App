Song 106
1. Who, who, I ask you who,
   Could separate me from God's love
   Who, who, I ask you who
   Could take me from His love

   \tThe love of God in Christ Jesus
   \tIn Christ Jesus, in Christ Jesus
   \tThe love of God in Christ Jesus
   \tIn Christ Jesus my Lord.

2. What, what I ask you what,
   Could separate me from God's love
   What, what I ask you what
   Could take me from His love

3. Life, death, nor any power
   Could separate me from God's love
   Things present, nor things to come
   Could take me from His love

4. Tribulation nor the sword
   Could separate, could separate
   We are more than conquerors
   Through the love of God

5. Nothing can separate
   Me from His love, from His love
   Nothing can separate
   Me from the love of God
