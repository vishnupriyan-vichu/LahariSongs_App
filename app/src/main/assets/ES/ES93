Song 93
1. The robe that He wears may be humble,
   And the path that His feet tread below,
   May be filled with deep hidden meaning,
   That others may not see or know.

   The days of His life and His dealing
   With His own may be hidden from view,
   But the love of His heart He has shown,
   As He raptured His own chosen few.

   \tLift ye heads, lift ye heads in His presence!
   \tO ye gates be ye lift up and sing!
   \tYe doors everlasting now lift up,
   \tAnd through you will come in your King.

   \tHe's the King, the royal King of Glory,
   \tThe Lord strong and mighty is He;
   \tHis glory will fill all the Temple,
   \tAnd all of the darkness will flee.

2. He was turned from the inn and the Temple,
   The world shook their head when He came;
   But it was the Royal King of Glory,
   They left all alone in the rain.

   Lift ye heads now and welcome this stranger,
   This lone Man from Nazareth;
   For He is the Royal King of Glory,
   He will reign from the Throne evermore.
