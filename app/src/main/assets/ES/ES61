Song 61
1. Make a joyful noise to the Lord,
   Serve the Lord with gladness;
   Come to His Throne, Singing this song:
   He's holy, holy, holy.

   \tEnter through His gates with a thankful heart,
   \tFill His courts with praise;
   \tOh, give thanks to Him, and bless His Name,
   \tAnd bless His Name, for He is holy;
   \tFor He is holy, holy, holy.

2. Know that the Lord God is good,
   He is our Creator;
   He is our King, He is our God,
   He's holy, holy, holy.

3. Sing unto the Lord a new song,
   Sing about His glory;
   Majesty and might, be unto our God,
   He's holy, holy, holy.

4. Swear that the Lord is alive,
   That He lives forever;
   He has the keys o'er hell and death,
   He's holy, holy, holy.
