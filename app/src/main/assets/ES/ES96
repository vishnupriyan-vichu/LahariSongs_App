Song 96
1. There was a Name hid through the passing ages,
   God kept it secret from each priest and seer;
   Because He knew that He would come in person,
   At the end time when His wife should appear.
   
   The spirit of the Bride and Groom united,
   Revealed to her the secrets of His love;
   And in the precious Name of her beloved,
   Beyond the grave she rose to realms above.
   
   \tEternity with time a passing memory,
   \tWill give the glory to the One who came;
   \tTo earth to take His bride in love and mercy,
   \tAnd give to her His own and precious Name.

2. The healing wings around the world are flying,
   In that new Name they set the captives free;
   And take the woman to her place of safety,
   Where in His Name, safe from the storm she'll be.
   
   And then I see the lost sheep for the slaughter,
   Go forth to die, they know that precious Name;
   And though they missed the secret of His coming,
   They give their lives, but do not die in vain.

3. The morning breaks, the glory of the dawning,
   Will bring the world beneath His righteous reign
   And as the earth receives her King from glory,
   They praise and sing the wonders of His Name.
   
   Beyond the thousand years when all is over,
   The great White Throne will mark the final day;
   And every knee will bow and kneel before Him,
   And every tongue this precious Name will say.
