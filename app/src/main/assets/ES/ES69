Song 69
1. O my beloved, faithful and true;
   The Son of David, I'm waiting on You;
   Take me to Heaven, to my final Home,
   And there I shall be, a jewel in Your crown.

   \tA jewel in Your crown - 2
   \tAnd there I shall be, a jewel in Your crown.

2. O my beloved, morning's bright Star;
   Higher than angels, First born of God;
   Heaven awaits Thee, for Your glorious day,
   And then my beloved, we'll fly away.

   \tWe'll fly away - 2
   \tAnd then my beloved, we'll fly away.
