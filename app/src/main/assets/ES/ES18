Song 18
   \tGod is a good God,
   \tEvery heartache He understands;
   \tThere is healing power, there are miracles,
   \tIn the touch of His wonderful hand.
   \tWhat He's done for others He will do for you,
   \tIf you only believe and trust Him too!
   \tFor God is a good God,
   \tAnd His goodness He will show to you!

1. Every day is like a leaf falling from the tree;
   Soon the tree of leaves will stand so bare and cold.
   But the hands that bring the flowers
   When winter snow is gone,
   Will awaken us in a world we've never known; - For God...

2. Every life is but a flame, my Lord caused to burn;
   Every star a shining world that my Lord owns.
   But though He owns the heavens,
   He still has time for you,
   If you only make your wants and wishes known; - For God...
