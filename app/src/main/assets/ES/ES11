Song 11
1. Come ye that love the Lord
   And let our joys be known,
   Join in the song with sweet accord - 2
   And thus surround the throne - 2
   
   \tWe're marching to Zion,
   \tBeautiful, beautiful Zion.
   \tWe're marching upward to Zion
   \tThe beautiful city of God.

2. Let those refuse to sing
   Who never knew our God;
   But children of the heavenly - 2
   May speak their joys abroad - 2
   
3. The hill of Zion yields
   A thousand sacred sweets
   Before we reach the heav'nly fields - 2
   Or walk the golden streets - 2

4. Then let our songs abound,
   And every tear be dry;
   We're marching through Emmanuel's ground - 2
   To fairer worlds on high - 2
