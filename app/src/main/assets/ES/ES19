Song 19
1. We're marching on not thinking of tomorrow,
   Our walk is blind step by step, hour by hour.
   The Word alone is light upon our path way,
   Showing us where we stand, the way we go.
   The last fierce battle we are facing now,
   Faith on the word is victory.

Chorus 1: God's not a man that He should tell a lie,
          His word is true, Hallelujah. - 2

2. We do not sin by doubting God's sure promises,
   Given to Abraham's seed so long ago.
   God is with us though all men may condemn us.
   The blood of the Lamb, it intercedes.
   We're wearing it rejoicing in our hearts,
   Our mouth with praises overflows.

3. The Kingdom's sceptre it should rise from Judah,
   The branch growing from Jesse's root.
   Unto Him all power on earth is given,
   The Heavenly hosts obey His will.
   As His beloved bride He has redeemed us,
   To Heaven's brightness, glorified.

4. Jacob's trouble, it has begun already,
   From Zion thy help comes, O Israel.
   The saints of God are gathered for the fight they wait,
   Risen from sleep to glorious life.
   'You hold your peace and recognize your God,
   The fight is mine!' Thus saith your God.

5. Can you remember still what peace does mean, O earth?
   It is at hand your Lord's present.
   The hundred four and forty thousand true seed,
   Sealed they are for the kingdom of peace.
   You're groaning still O bound creation,
   A little while and you are free.

6. And power I will give unto my witnesses,
   Now will Jerusalem be measured out.
   By this act He does prepare the stage for Him,
   He that stops war and breaks the bow.
   The Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel,
   As Son of man He's known to you.

Chorus 2: Boldly march on the scripture will be fulfilled,
          The voice that tells come up hither.
          God's not a man that He should tell a lie,
          His word is true, Hallelujah - 2
