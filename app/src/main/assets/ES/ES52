Song 52
1. Jerusalem we bring to you good tidings and great joy.
   Comfortably we speak to you God's promises enjoy.
   He'll dwell in the midst of thee,
   You are the city of truth;
   Happy young boys and happy young girls |
   Shall lift up their voices in thee | - 2

   \tJerusalem, Jerusalem! Lift up your gates and sing:
   \tHosanna in the highest, Hosanna to your King! - 2

2. Rejoice, O daughter of Jerusalem - Rejoice greatly and sing!
   Behold thy King now cometh, with His saints to bring;
   He shall speak sweet peace to thee,
   He'll rule from sea to sea.
   We are His people and He's our God |
   In truth and righteousness. | - 2 - Jerusalem
   
   \tJerusalem, Jerusalem! Lift up your gates and sing:
   \tHosanna in the highest, Hosanna for ever more! - 2
