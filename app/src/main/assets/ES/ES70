Song 70
1. O my brother do you know the Saviour,
   Who is wondrous kind and true?
   He's the rock of your salvation;
   There's honey in the rock for you.
   
   \tOh there's honey in the rock my brother,
   \tThere's honey in the rock for you!
   \tLeave your sins for the blood to cover,
   \tThere's honey in the rock for you!

2. Have you tasted that the Lord is gracious?
   Do you walk in the way that's new?
   Have you drunk from the living fountain?
   There's honey in the rock for you.

3. Do you pray unto God the Father,
   What will Thou have me to do?
   Never fear He'll surely answer,
   There's honey in the rock for you.

4. Then go out to the streets and by-ways,
   Preach the word to the many and few;
   Say to every fallen brother:
   'There's honey in the rock for you'.
