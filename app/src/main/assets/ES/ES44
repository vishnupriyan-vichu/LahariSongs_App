Song 44
1. In that day shall this song be sung in the
   Land of Judah - Hallelujah!
   In that day shall this song be sung in the
   Land of Judah - Hallelujah!
   
   \tWe have a strong city
   \tWhere no evil can trod
   \tIts walls and bulwarks are salvation,
   \tAppointed only by God.
   
   \tWhere, where? Oh tell us where!
   \tIn the land of Judah.
   \tWhere, where? We declare:
   \tIn the land of Judah, Hallelujah!

2. Open ye the gates,
   That the righteous nation
   Who keepeth truth may enter in
   And flee from tribulation.

3. The sceptre's undeparted from Judah,
   A law-giver from His feet,
   Till Shiloh come, and unto Him
   Shall the people gather to greet.

4. Naomi heard in Moab,
   How the Lord had given bread,
   To His chosen people in Judah land,
   She knew her family there could be fed.

5. Our God is known in Judah,
   His name is great in Israel,
   His tabernacle's in Jerusalem,
   His dwelling place is on Zion's hill.

6. The name of Judah was terror,
   To Egypt's national ear,
   Mere mention of the land of Judah
   Filled Egyptian hearts with fear.

7. Up from the plains of Moab,
   Came Moses to Jericho,
   To view the land given to the tribes,
   The land of Judah he saw we know.

8. From the east there came three wise men,
   Looking for the King of the Jews,
   It was Jesus Christ born in Bethlehem,
   Star of the east had brought them good news.
