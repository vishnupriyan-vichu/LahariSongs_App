Song 15
1. Glory to God in the Highest!
   Glory to God, Glory to God,
   Glory to God in the Highest! - We shout eternally.
   
   The Son of David has come down;
   His little bride He sought and found;
   He'll take her to His home above;
   She'll fly away like a snow white dove.
   
   \tGlory to God in the Highest! - 2
   \tGlory - 4 Glory to Him evermore

2. Glory to God in the Highest!
   Glory to God, Glory to God,
   Glory to God in the Highest! We shout eternally.

   Heaven our home soon we will see;
   In new Jerusalem we will be;
   With all the hosts of heaven bright,
   We'll sing our songs in robes of white. - Glory to God

3. Glory to God in the Highest!
   Glory to God, Glory to God,
   Glory to God in the Highest! We shout eternally.

   We've had His guidance all the way,
   His boundless mercy every day;
   From death He set His loved ones free,
   Saved and redeemed, a soul like me. - Glory to God
