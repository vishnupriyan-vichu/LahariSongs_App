Song 62
1. My beloved Thou art mine;
   I am Thy servant forever Thine.
   Thou art the way and Thou art the Truth - 2
   Life everlasting we praise Thee - 2

2. In times of trouble Thou art my help;
   To those that seek Thee a sure refuge.
   Thou art the One that saves me from death - 2
   The great deliverer who lifts me from sin - 2

3. Though my foes surround me all day;
   And sorrows compass me from every side.
   Shall I forget my beloved One - 2
   He gave eternal life to me - 2
