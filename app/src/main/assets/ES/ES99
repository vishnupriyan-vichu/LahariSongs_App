Song 99
1. There's a royal banner given for display,
   To the soldiers of the King;
   As an ensign fair we lift it up today,
   While as ransomed ones we sing.

   \tMarching on, marching on,
   \tFor Christ count everything but loss;
   \tAnd proclaim Him King, toil and sing,
   \tNeath the banner of His love.

2. Though the foe may rage and gather as the flood,
   Let the standard be displayed;
   And beneath its fold as soldiers of the Lord,
   For the truth be not dismayed.	- Marching

3. Over land and sea wherever man may dwell,
   Make the glorious tidings known;
   Of the crimson banner now the story tell,
   While the Lord shall claim His own.	- Marching

4. When the glory dawns, it's drawing very near,
   It is hastening day by day;
   Then before our King the foe shall disappear,
   And His love the world shall sway.	- Marching
