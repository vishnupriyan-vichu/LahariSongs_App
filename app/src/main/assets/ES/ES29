Song 29
1. Time is filled with swift transaction
   Naught of earth unmoved can stand;
   Build your hopes on things eternal;
   Hold to God's unchanging hand.
   
   \tHold to God's unchanging hand - 2
   \tBuild your hopes on things eternal;
   \tHold to God's unchanging hand.

2. When your journey is completed,
   And to God you have been true:
   Fair and bright your home in glory,
   Your enraptured soul will view.

3. Covet not this world's vain riches,
   That so rapidly decay.
   Seek to gain the Heavenly treasures:
   They will never pass away.
