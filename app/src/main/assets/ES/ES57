Song 57
Joint Chor.: Know that the Lord is God indeed;
             We are His flock He doth us feed.
             Oh enter then His gates with praise;
             Praise loud and bless His name always.

Chorus: Hallelujah, salvation and glory and honour and
        Power unto our Lord God!
        Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and
        Thanksgiving forever be unto our God!

1. Oh bless the Lord my soul, His grace to thee proclaim;
   And all that is within me join to
   Bless His holy name.

2. Oh bless the Lord my soul, His mercies bear in mind;
   Forget not all His benefits,
   The Lord to thee is kind.

3. He will not always chide, He will with patience wait;
   His wrath is ever slow to rise,
   And ready to abate.

4. He pardons all thy sins, prolongs thy feeble breath;
   He healeth thine infirmities,
   And ransoms thee from death.

5. He clothes thee with His love, He holds thee with His Truth;
   And like the eagle,
   He renews the vigour of thy youth.

6. Then bless His holy name, whose grace hath made thee whole;
   Whose loving kindness crowns thy days,
   Oh bless the Lord my soul.

7. Exalt the Lord our God, and make a joyful noise;
   Come singing in His glorious presence and
   Gladly serve the Lord.

8. Ye servants of the Lord, that stand before the Lord;
   Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and
   Bless the Lord your God.
