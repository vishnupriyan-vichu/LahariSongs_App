Song 71
1. Oh worship the King all glorious above,
   Oh gratefully sing His power and His love.
   Our shield and defender, the ancient of days,
   Pavillioned in splendour and girded with praise.

2. Oh tell of His might, oh sing of His grace,
   Whose robe is the light, Whose canopy space.
   His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form,
   And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

3. The earth with its store of wonders untold,
   Almighty Thy power Hath founded of old.
   Hath 'stablished it fast by a changeless decree,
   And round it hath cast like a mantle the sea.

4. Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?
   It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
   It streams from the hills it descends to the plain,
   And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.

5. Frail children of dust and feeble as frail,
   In Thee do we trust nor find Thee to fail.
   Thy mercies how tender How firm to the end;
   Our maker, defender redeemer and friend.

6. O measureless might, ineffable love;
   While angels delight to hymn Thee above.
   Thy ransomed creation though feeble there lays,
   With true adoration shall sing to Thy praise.
