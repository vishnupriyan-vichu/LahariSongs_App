Song 2
1. All hail the power of Jesus' name,
   Let angels prostrate fall;
   Bring forth the royal diadem,
   And crown Him - 4 Lord of all!
   
2. Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
   Ye ransomed from the fall,
   Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
   And crown Him - 4 Lord of all!
   
3. Let every kindred, every tribe,
   On this terrestrial ball,
   To Him all majesty ascribe,
   And crown Him - 4 Lord of all!
   
4. O that with yonder sacred throng,
   We at His feet may fall!
   We'll join the everlasting song,
   And crown Him - 4 Lord of all!
