Song 1
1. I have lived a life of sin,
   In this world I'm living in,
   I have done forbidden things I shouldn't do,
   I asked a beggar 'long the way,
   If he could tell me where to stay,
   Where I could find real happiness
   And love that's true.

   \tAcross the bridge there's no more sorrow,
   \tAcross the bridge there's no more pain,
   \tThe sun will shine across the river,
   \tAnd you'll never be unhappy again.

2. Follow the foot prints of the King,
   Till you hear the voices ring,
   They'll be singing out the glory of the Lamb,
   The river Jordan will be there,
   The sound of trumpets you will hear,
   And you'll behold the most precious place
   Ever known to man. - Across

3. It was 'neath His precious blood,
   That we crossed the swelling flood,
   For the blood of Christ has bridged the stream of death,
   Now we glorify our King,
   And the angels hear us sing,
   The new song of full redemption
   That we bring. - Across
