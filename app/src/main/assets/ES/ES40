Song 40
   \tI shall not be, I shall not be moved - 2
   \tJust like a tree that's planted by the waters,
   \tOh I shall not be moved.

1. Son of God is leading, I shall not be moved;
   On His word I'm feeding, I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
   Oh I shall not be moved.

2. If I trust Him ever, I shall not be moved;
   He will fail me never, I shall not be moved
   Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
   Oh I shall not be moved.

3. Lord God's my redeemer, I shall not be moved;
   In His love for ever, I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
   Oh I shall not be moved.
