Song 54
1. I have found His grace is all complete,
   He supplieth every need.
   While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
   I am free, yes, free indeed.

   \tIt is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   \tFull of glory, full of glory.
   \tIt is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   \tAnd the half has never yet been told.

2. I have found the pleasure I once craved,
   It is joy and peace within.
   What a wondrous blessing, I am saved,
   From the awful gulf of sin.

3. I have found that hope so bright and clear,
   Living in the realm of grace.
   O the Saviour's presence is so near,
   I can see His smiling face.

4. I have found the joy no tongue can tell,
   How its waves of glory roll.
   It is like a great overflowing well,
   Springing up within my soul.
