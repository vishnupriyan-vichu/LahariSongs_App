Song 60
1. Lord, I hear of showers of blessings,
   Thou art scattering full and free;
   Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
   Let some drops now fall on me.
   
   \tEven me, even me,			|
   \tLet Thy blessings fall on me.	| - 2

2. Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
   Let me love and cling to Thee;
   I am longing for Thy favour,
   Whilst Thou calling, call on me.

3. Pass me not, O mighty spirit,
   Let Thy light now flow through me;
   Lift me from the worldly darkness,
   Let me always dwell with Thee.
