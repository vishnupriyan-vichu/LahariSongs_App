Song 20
1. God's Son is on earth - His own to gather
   And take them back home - When day is done
   The living Bridegroom - The word incarnate
   Oh Hallelujah, for us He's come.

2. The Lord of Glory, in flesh appearing
   Emmanuel living among His own
   The secret hidden through all the ages,
   Oh Hallelujah, The rolling stone.

3. His mercy to us endureth ever
   His goodness reaches even to me.
   Soon in His likeness, oh glorious dawning,
   We will dwell with Him - Eternally.
