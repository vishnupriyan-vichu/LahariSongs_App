Song 101
1. Thou my everlasting portion,
   More than friend or life to me,
   All along my pilgrim journey,
   Saviour let me walk with Thee.
   
   \tClose to Thee, close to Thee - 2
   \tAll along my pilgrim journey,
   \tSaviour let me walk with Thee.

2. Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
   Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
   Gladly will I toil and suffer,
   Only let me walk with Thee.

3. Lead me through the vale of shadows,
   Bear me over life's fitful sea;
   Then the gates of life eternal,
   May I enter Lord with Thee.
