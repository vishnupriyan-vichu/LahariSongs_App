Song 53
   \tJesus never fails, Jesus never fails,
   \tHeaven and earth may pass away,
   \tChrist Jesus never fails.

1. Earthly friends may prove untrue,
   Doubts and fears assail;
   One still loves and cares for you,
   One who will not fail. - Jesus

2. Though the sky be dark and drear,
   Fierce and strong the gale;
   Just remember He is near,
   And He will not fail. - Jesus

3. In life's dark and bitter hour,
   Love will still prevail;
   Trust His everlasting power,
   Jesus will not fail. - Jesus
