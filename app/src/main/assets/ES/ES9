Song 9
   Humming: mmmm.... aaaaa......
   
   By the rivers of Babylon
   Where we sat down
   Yea, yea we wept,
   When we remembered Zion - 2

1. When the wicked carried us away in captivity
   Required from us a song
   Now how shall we sing the Lord's song
   In a strange land - 2

2. Let the words of our mouths
   And the meditation of our hearts
   Be acceptable in Thy sight
   Here tonight - 2		- By the rivers...
