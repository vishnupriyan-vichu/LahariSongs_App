Song 103
1. Jesus has come, Christ Jesus has come,
   To change us from mortal to eternity;
   Changed to the glory of the Lord.

   \tWe shall be changed, We shall be changed,
   \tChanged from mortal to eternity,
   \tChanged to the glory of the Lord.

2. O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?
   We'll be changed from mortal to eternity,
   Changed to the glory of the Lord.

3. In the twinkling of an eye, In the twinkling of an eye,
   We'll be changed from mortal to eternity,
   Changed to the glory of the Lord.

4. We have overcome, We have overcome,
   We'll be changed from mortal to eternity,
   Changed to the glory of the Lord.
