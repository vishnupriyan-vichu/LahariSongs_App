Song 64
1. We have reached that dear land,
   On a far away strand,
   'Tis a beautiful home of the soul.
   Filled by Jesus on high,
   Where we never shall die,
   'Tis a land where we'll never grow old.

   \tNever grow old - 2 |
   \tIn a land where we'll never grow old. | - 2

   When our work here is done,
   And life's crown has been won,
   Our troubles and trials are no more.
   Our sorrows will end,
   And our voices will blend,
   With the loved ones who've gone home before.
