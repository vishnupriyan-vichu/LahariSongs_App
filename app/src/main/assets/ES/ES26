Song 26
1. He leadeth me ! O blessed thought!
   O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
   Whatever I do, wherever I go,
   Still 'tis God's Hand that leadeth me.
   
   \tHe leadeth me, He leadeth me,
   \tBy His own hand He leadeth me.
   \tHis faithful follower I would be,
   \tFor by His hand He leadeth me.

2. Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
   Where flowers of worry ever bloom.
   By waters still o'er troubled sea,
   Still 'tis my God that leadeth me.

3. Lord I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
   Nor ever murmur or repine.
   Content whatever lot I see,
   Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

4. And when all life on earth is done,
   When by Thy grace, the victory's won.
   We've crossed all tides of mortal sea,
   Since 'tis Christ Jesus who will glorify me.
