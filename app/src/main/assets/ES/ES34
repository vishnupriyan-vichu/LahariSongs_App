Song 34
1. I am Thine O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
   And it told Thy love to me.
   But I long to rise, in the arms of faith,
   And be closer drawn to Thee.

   \tDraw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
   \tThrough Thy blessed Sacrifice;
   \tDraw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,
   \tLet me see Thy loving face.

2. Consecrate me now, to Thy service Lord,
   By Thy power of grace divine.
   Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
   And my will be lost in Thine.

3. O the pure delight of a single hour,
   That before Thy throne I spend.
   When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee my God,
   I commune as friend with friend.

4. There are depths of love, that I cannot know,
   Till I cross the narrow sea.
   There are heights of joy, that I may not reach,
   Till I rest in peace with Thee.
