Song 7
1. Blessed be the name of the Lord - 2
   From the risin' of the sun - Until it's goin' down
   The name of the Lord shall be praised.
   Though He's high above - I feel Him all around;
   The name of the Lord shall be praised!
   
2. Blessed be the name of the Lord - 2
   Though the leaders of the land - Try to put Him down,
   The name of the Lord shall be praised.
   Since the beginning of time - Until Thy kingdom come,
   The name of the Lord shall be praised!
   
   \tThough I walk in the shadow of death
   \tI will fear no evil,
   \tFor Thou O Lord art with me!
   \tThrough the wind, through the storm,
   \tYou are with me...
   
   \tBlessed be the name of the Lord - 4
   \tBlessed be the name (Blessed be the name) -2
   \tOh blessed... (Blessed be the name)
   \tBe the name of the Lord... Oh... Oh... Oh...
   \tBlessed be the name of the Lord - 6
