Song 25
1. God, who made the earth, the air, the sky, the sea,
   Who gave the light it's birth, careth for me.

2. God, who made the grass, the flower, the fruit, the tree,
   The day and night to pass, Careth for me.

3. God, who made the sun, the moon, the stars, is He
   Who when life's clouds come on, Careth for me.

4. God, who made all things, on earth, in air, in sea,
   Who changing seasons brings, Careth for me.

5. God, who sent His Son, to redeem me;
   He, if I lean on Him, will care for me.

6. When in heaven's bright land, I all His loved ones see,
   I'll sing with that blest band, God Cared for me.

7. God, His kingdom rules, through air and sky and sea,
   The song will ever be, God Cares for me.
