Song 85
1. Seek the Lord while He may be found,
   Call upon Him while He is near;
   Let the wicked forsake his ways,
   And the unrighteous man his thoughts;
   
   \tAnd let him return to the Lord unto our God.
   \tAnd He will have mercy upon him;
   \tHe will abundantly pardon him;
   \tReturn to the Lord.
   
   \tSeek the Lord...................unto our God.
   
   \tAnd He will abundantly pardon,
   \tHe will abundantly pardon him;
   \tReturn to the Lord.

2. For you will go out with joy,
   And be led forth with peace;
   The mountains and hills will break forth
   Into shouts of joy before you,
   And the trees of the fields will clap their hands.
   
   \tAnd He will abundantly pardon,
   \tHe will abundantly pardon you;
   \tReturn to the Lord.

   \tSeek the Lord...................unto our God.

   \tAnd He will abundantly pardon,
   \tHe will abundantly pardon you;
   \tReturn to the Lord - 3
