Song 90
1. The law of the Lord is perfect,
   Converting the soul;
   The testimony of the Lord is sure,
   Making wise the simple.

   \tMore to be desired are they than gold,
   \tYea than much fine gold;
   \tSweeter also than honey
   \tAnd the honey comb.

2. The statutes of the Lord are right,
   Rejoicing the heart;
   The commandment of the Lord is pure,
   Enlightening the eyes. - More to be

3. The fear of the Lord is clean,
   Enduring forever;
   The judgements of the Lord are true,
   And righteous altogether. - More to be

   \tMoreover by them is Thy servant warned,
   \tIs Thy servant warned;
   \tAnd in keeping of them
   \tThere is great reward. - More to be
