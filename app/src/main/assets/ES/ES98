Song 98
1. There is a Name I love to hear,
   I love to hear that Word;
   It sounds like music in my ear,
   The sweetest ever heard.

   Oh how I love Jesus - 3
   Because He first loved me.

2. The Lamb He shed His blood for me
   He died to set me free;
   That He may claim me for His own,
   Forever with Him to be.		- Oh

3. His mercy is so wonderful,
   He hides me under His wing;
   His love for me no tongue can tell,
   How can I help but sing.	- Oh
