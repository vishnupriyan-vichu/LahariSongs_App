Song 73
1. Lord please remember I'm just made of clay,
   Help me believe in what I could be,
   And teach me Thy way.
   Show me the stairway I have to climb;
   Lord for my sake, teach me to take
   One day at a time.
   
   \tOne day at a time Christ Jesus
   \tThat's all I'm asking from You;
   \tJust give me the strength
   \tTo do everyday what I have to do.
   
   \tYesterday's gone, Christ Jesus,
   \tAnd forever it sure'll not be mine.
   \tLord help me today, show me the way,
   \tOne day at a time.

2. Lord since you're come back,
   And walked among men;
   Well dear Lord You know, as You travelled below,
   It's worse now in sin.
   Pushing and shoving, crowding my mind;
   Lord for my sake, teach me to take
   One day at a time.

3. The world has its problems;
   It's not trouble-free;
   Grant me the power to live every hour,
   Pleasing to Thee.
   Lead me and guide me
   Saviour Divine,
   Lord for my sake, teach me to take
   One day at a time.
