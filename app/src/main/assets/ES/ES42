Song 42
1. I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus,
   Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true.
   I would tell you how He changed my life completely;
   He did something that no other friend could do.
   
   \tNo one ever cared for me like my Lord God;
   \tThere's no other friend so kind as He.
   \tNo one else could take the sin and darkness from me;
   \tO how much He cares for me.

2. All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me,
   All my heart was full of misery and woe;
   But He placed His strong and loving arms around me,
   And He led me in the way I ought to go.

3. Every day He comes to me with new assurance,
   More and more I understand His words and love;
   But I never knew why He just came to save me,
   Till the day I saw His blessed face and love.
