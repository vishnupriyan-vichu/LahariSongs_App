Song 3
   All that dwell upon the earth,
   Hear His trumpet sound!
   Fear God who created you,
   His judgement hour has come.
   
   \tFear God! Fear God!
   \tFear God and give glory to Him, fear God!
   \tFear God! Creator of heaven and earth.
   
1. Do good to your fellow men,
   Be honest and be pure;
   Forsake all your evil ways,
   The time has come to fear.	- Fear God
   
2. There's but one God you know,
   Don't trust in wood or stone.
   In His hands your life is held
   For He is God alone.		- Fear God
   
3. If you fear your Creator,
   To Him you'll give glory;
   You'll obey His commandments,
   And worship Him alone.	- Fear God
