Song 37
1. I lay in Zion - for a foundation a stone - 2
   A tried stone, a precious corner stone is your foundation,
   Is your foundation;
   A tried stone, a precious corner stone
   He that believeth shall - shall not make haste.

   \tWonderful, Counsellor,
   \tThe mighty God, The everlasting Father!
   \tWonderful, Counsellor,
   \tThe Prince of peace! - I lay in Zion
