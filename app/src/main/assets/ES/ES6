Song 6
   \tAmen halleluiah - 2 O sing all ye heavenly host!
   \tPraise ye the Lord - 2
   \tEverything that hath breath, Praise the Lord!
   
1. Hallelujah praise ye the Lord
   All ye nations of the earth.
   Hallelujah bless the Lord God
   O the bride of Christ Jesus.
   Make a joyful noise unto the Lord;
   Serve ye the Lord with gladness.
   He has made us, we are His people;
   And the sheep of His pasture.
   
2. O sing unto the Lord a new song,
   He hath done marvellous things.
   He remembered His mercy and truth
   Towards the house of David.
   Bless ye the Lord all ye servants,
   Forget not all His benefits.
   Thank ye the Lord,
   He has given victory over death and hell.

3. Serve the Lord our God with fear;
   All ye rejoice with trembling.
   Hallelujah Blessed be they that do put their trust in Him.
   O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion;
   When the Lord brings His people
   Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.

4. I will bless Thee, my blessed Lord God,
   Who hath given me counsel;
   I have set the Lord before me.
   Keep me as the apple of Thine eye;
   Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings.
   Surely goodness and mercy
   Shall follow me all the days of my life;
   I will dwell in the house of the Lord forevermore.
   
5. Victory in the blood of Christ Jesus,
   Victory in the blood of Christ Jesus!
   Jesus never fails, Christ Jesus never fails - 2
   Praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good,
   For His mercy endureth forever.
   Hallelujah, Hallelujah - 2
