Song 72
1. Once the mighty King eternal
   Gave His life for you and me
   For the bride and all His people
   As a lamb one day was slain.
   King eternal - 2 Lowly Thou hast died for me -2

2. Opened He the cleansing fountain
   For the house of David's Son;
   Through the righteousness He giveth,
   We the kingdom enter in.
   Precious fountain - 2 Opened wide for all my sins - 2

3. Secretly on earth appearing
   As a thief to claim His own;
   Now the Kingdom has been given,
   King of Glory on the Throne.
   King of Glory - 2 Came to earth to claim His own - 2

4. Over earth and throughout Heaven
   Reigning for eternity!
   Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
   Praises we bring unto Thee.
   Crowned in Glory - 2 We our living God will see -2

5. Everything united singing
   Through His glorious domain;
   The new song of full redemption,
   Rising to His precious Name.
   Song of praises - 2 We will ever bring to Thee -2
