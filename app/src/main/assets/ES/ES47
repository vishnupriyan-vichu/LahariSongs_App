Song 47
1. It is glory just to walk with Him whose blood has ransomed me,
   It is rapture for my soul each day;
   It is joy divine to feel Him near where'er my path may be,
   Bless the Lord, it's glory all the way!
   
   \tIt is glory just to walk with Him,
   \tIt is glory just to walk with Him;
   \tHe will guide my steps aright
   \tThru the vale and o're the height,
   \tIt is glory just to walk with Him.

2. It is glory when the shadows fall to know that He is near,
   O what joy to simply trust and pray!
   It is glory to abide in Him when skies above are clear,
   Yes, with Him it's glory all the way!

3. 'Twill be glory when I walk with Him on heaven's golden shore,
   Never from His side again to stray;
   'Twill be glory, wondrous glory with Christ Jesus evermore,
   Everlasting glory all the way!
