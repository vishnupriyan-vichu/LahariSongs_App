Song 102
   \tTurn on the Sun, turn on the Sun,
   \tTell everyone, our Lord God is King!
   \tTurn off the wind, the thunder and the rain,
   \tTurn on the Sun let's smile again.

1. Tinker, tailor man,
   Radiate all the love you can;
   Lawyer or engineer,
   Let His word be your pioneer.

   \tTurn on the Sun, turn on the Sun,
   \tOpen your heart, let God come in;
   \tBad times are o'er, His kingdom has come,
   \tTurn on the Sun, let's smile again.

2. Minor, steeplejack,
   Accept God and to Him come back;
   Sailor or steward,
   Here's a message you can't ignore.
   
   \tTurn on the Sun, turn on the Sun,
   \tTell everyone our Lord God is King!
   \tTurn off the wind, the thunder and the rain,
   \tTurn on the Sun, let's smile again.

3. Count up all His goodness for you,
   Turn on the Sun, turn on the Sun!
   Worship your Creator and do,
   Turn on the Sun, let's smile again!
   
   \tLala la.... lala la.... lala la.... lala la
   \tThis is the day,
   \tThis is the day that the Lord has made - 2
   \tWe will rejoice,
   \tWe will rejoice and be glad in it - 2
   \tThis is the day that the Lord has made,
   \tWe will rejoice and be glad in it;
   \tThis is the day,
   \tThis is the day that the Lord.... has.... made.
