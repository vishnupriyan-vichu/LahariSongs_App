Song 63
1. My heavenly home is bright and fair;
   I feel like travelling on;
   No pain, nor death can enter there,
   I feel like travelling on.

   \tYes, I feel like travelling on,
   \tI feel like travelling on.
   \tMy heavenly home is bright and fair,
   \tI feel like travelling on.

2. Its glittering towers the sun outshine,
   I feel like travelling on;
   That heavenly mansion shall be mine,
   I feel like travelling on.

3. The Lord has been so good to me,
   I feel like travelling on;
   Until that blessed home I see,
   I feel like travelling on.
