Song 24
   \tHe brought me in -2
   \tOh I praise God, He brought me in;
   \tJust look out yonder, where I have been;
   \tOh I praise God, He brought me in.

1. Just when I felt like, all hope was gone;
   Just when I dreaded, to face the dawn;
   My soul was failing because of sin;
   But just in time He brought me in. - He

2. The gentile time, now has gone down;
   Men's hearts are failing, because of sin;
   I know the Lord, He has come down;
   Oh I praise God, He brought me in. - He

3. He has redeemed me, to be His bride;
   His righteousness He did impute on me;
   Now I am free from, all bondages;
   Oh I praise God, He brought me in. - He
