Song 88
1. Shone clear David's Star on the fields afar,
   Led us clearly on, through the Word,
   There in pastures green, where no one had been,
   Found we rest, beside the living stream.

   \tShining brightly, leading us to glory,
   \tEver, upward, taking us along.
   \tStar of David, lights the hidden pathway,
   \tAnd we rise to sing redemption's song.

2. On the Throne His Son, David's seed has come,
   Of His mercy now, here we sing.
   Soon in Heaven bright, where there is no night,
   Judah's tribe will crown Him as the King.

3. God's promise is sure, mercy does endure,
   Through His promised One, on the Throne.
   Scattered not we'll be, safe eternally,
   He has gathered us to take us Home.

4. A new song we sing, homage to Him bring,
   Through the blood He shed, to provide.
   A new robe of white, perfect in His sight,
   'Neath His love and care, we will abide.

5. Long the wait has been, through the shadows dim,
   Till the Star arose, shining bright.
   Now the journey's won, David's Son has come,
   And His mercy shall forever endure.
