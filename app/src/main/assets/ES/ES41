Song 41
1. I walked one day along a country road,
   And there a stranger journeyed too;
   And hid behind the garments of a thief,
   I saw He was someone I knew.
   
   \t'Come, leave this world and follow Me!'
   \tI hear the Blessed Bridegroom call;
   \tHow could I make a lesser sacrifice?
   \tSince He, has given, His all.

2. 'Oh, I would go with you, dear God,' I cried,
   And Lo! a white cloud did appear;
   He came with flames of fire in His eyes;
   I heard Him whisper, 'Do not fear.'

3. I saw His path had been a lonely one;
   He'd travelled like a rolling stone.
   I knew that God had come to take His bride,
   And I no longer felt alone.

4. I'm waiting now until the hour comes,
   For glorified we soon will be;
   And I will sing the praises of His name,
   And thank Him for His love for me.
