Song 81
   \tRejoice and sing ye that know the Lord,
   \tWorship with me our God and King;
   \tRejoice and sing ye that love the Lord,
   \tBless with me His holy Name.

1. Praise Him for He is so good,
   For His mercy doth forever endure;
   He shed His precious blood, and took me out of snares,
   And freed me from death and sin.
   Praise His holy Name - 3

2. Praise Him for He's called me by name,
   When I was weary and lost in world's pain;
   He didn't leave me there, Oh He took me out of there;
   And made me on a rock to stand.
   Praise His mighty Name - 3

3. Praise Him for I'm happy and free,
   In the Lord who's been so good to me;
   May He ever be my guide, I will stay by His side,
   Throughout eternity.
   Praise His holy Name -3
