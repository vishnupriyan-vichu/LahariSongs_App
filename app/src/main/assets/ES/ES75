Song 75
1. Pass me not, O gentle saviour,
   Hear my humble cry;
   While on others Thou art calling,
   Do not pass me by.
   
   \tSaviour, Saviour,
   \tHear my humble cry;
   \tWhile on others Thou art calling,
   \tDo not pass me by.

2. Let me at the throne of mercy,
   Find a sweet relief;
   Kneeling there in deep contrition,
   Help my unbelief. - Saviour

3. Trusting only in Thy merit,
   Would I seek Thy face;
   Heal my wounded broken spirit,
   Save me by Thy grace. - Saviour

4. Thou the spring of all my comfort,
   More than life to me;
   Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
   Whom in heaven but Thee? - Saviour
