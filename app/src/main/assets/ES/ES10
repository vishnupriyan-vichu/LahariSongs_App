Song 10
   \tChrist Jesus said:
   \tCome to the waters, stand by My side,
   \tI know you are thirsty, you won't be denied;
   \tHe felt every teardrop, when in darkness I cried,
   \tAnd He came to remind me, that for those tears He died.

1. You said You'd come and share all my sorrows,
   You said You'd be there for all my tomorrows;
   I came so close to sending You away,
   But just like You promised, You came here to stay;
   Your mercy's so great.

2. Your goodness' so great I can't understand,
   And dear Lord I know, that all this was planned;
   I know You're here Lord, and always will be,
   Your love burst my chains, and in You I'm free;
   Christ Jesus I need.

3. Christ Jesus I give You my heart and my soul,
   I know that without You I'll never be whole;
   Christ Jesus You've opened all the right doors;
   I thank You and praise you from this humble shore;
   Take me, I'm yours.
