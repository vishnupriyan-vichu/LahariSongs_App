Song 68
1. Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,
   Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made;
   I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
   Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
   
   \tThen sings my soul, my King and God to Thee: |
   \tHow great Thou art, How great Thou art. | - 2

2. When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
   And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
   When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
   And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze. - Then

3. When through His word my dear Lord comes to meet me,
   When I do think of all His gracious deeds;
   How He hath blessed and loved His chosen people,
   With never failing mercy by and by. - Then

4. And when my Lord hath taken me to glory,
   I will admire the beauty of my King;
   Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
   And there proclaim, 'My God, How great Thou art!' - Then
