Song 89
1. Sweet hour of praise, sweet hour of praise,
   That calls me in the Son's bright rays;
   And bids me at my Father's Throne,
   Praise Him for all things now made known.
   
   In hours of distress and grief,
   My soul has often found relief;
   And oft escaped the tempter's haze,
   By thy return, sweet hour of praise.

2. Sweet hour of praise, sweet hour of praise,
   Thy wings shall my petitions raise;
   To Him whose truth and faithfulness
   Engage the waiting soul to bless.

   And since He bids me seek His face,
   Believe His word and trust His grace;
   I'll trust Him in these closing days,
   And wait for thee, sweet hour of praise.

3. Sweet hour of praise, sweet hour of praise,
   We'll worship oft throughout our days;
   Till from mount Zion's lofty height
   I view my home and take my flight.

   This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise,
   To seize the everlasting prize;
   And shout while passing through the air,
   Praise God, praise God, forever there.
