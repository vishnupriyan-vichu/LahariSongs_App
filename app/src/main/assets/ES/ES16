Song 16
1. Great are the deeds thou hast done in our lives,
   Adoring we worship thy holy name;
   Together we praise thy wondrous grace,
   Oh, thou beloved of our souls.

   \tGlory to thee Christ Jesus alone, - 2
   \tAll that hath breath join and sing along:
   \tGlory to thee, Christ Jesus alone!

2. Oh thou Almighty King of Kings,
   Revealest thyself to the ones who believe;
   Where two or three are united in prayer,
   Thy presence will be among them right there.

3. Thou hast redeemed us oh King of our souls,
   Hast filled with thy spirit and made us thine own;
   With eternal life thou hast blessed us in love,
   Forever and ever thine we shall be.
