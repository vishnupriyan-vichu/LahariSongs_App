Song 32
1. How did this come, to one like me,
   That I can see myself with Thee;
   The pearly gates were open wide,
   Rejoicing believing I went inside;
   Living Word, true Word, brought me to this heavenly place.
   
   \tYou are the King of kings,
   \tYou are the Lord of lords,
   \tYou are upon the throne;
   \tYou are the King of kings,
   \tYou are the Lord of lords,
   \tGlory to Thee alone;

   \tYou are the King of kings,
   \tYou are the Lord of lords,
   \tI now belong to Thee;
   \tYou are the King of kings,
   \tYou are the Lord of lords,
   \tUnited I am with Thee.

2. Him I can see, Him I can see,
   In beauty I behold His face;
   As a jewel of His He stole me away,
   In His holy temple I have a place
   Living Word, true Word, brought me to this heavenly place.

3. How did it come to one like me,
   The resurrected saints I see?
   We can hear the voice of the Living Word;
   United we rise before the Lord.
   Living Word, true Word, brought me to this heavenly place.

4. We are redeemed, we are redeemed,
   No tears nor sorrow we bear;
   We're free from all earth's grief and care;
   Through the Lamb that has taken our sins away.
   Living Word, true Word, brought me to this heavenly place.
