Song 17
1. God be with you till we meet again,
   By His counsels guide uphold you,
   With His sheep securely fold you,
   God be with you till we meet again.

   \tTill we meet, till we meet,
   \tTill we meet at Jesus' feet.
   \tTill we meet, till we meet,
   \tGod be with you, till we meet again.

2. God be with you, till we meet again,
   'Neath His wings, securely hide you,
   Daily manna still provide you,
   God be with you, till we meet again.

3. God be with you, till we meet again,
   When life's perils thick confound you,
   Put His arms unfailing 'round you,
   God be with you, till we meet again.
