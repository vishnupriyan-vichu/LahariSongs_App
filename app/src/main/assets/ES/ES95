Song 95
1. There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
   A glad and a joyous refrain;
   I sing it again and again,
   Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

   \tPeace, peace, sweet peace,
   \tWonderful gift from above;
   \tO wonderful wonderful peace,
   \tSweet peace, the gift of God's love.

2. Through Christ Jesus peace was made,
   My debt by His death was all paid;
   No other foundation is laid,
   Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.	- Peace

3. When Christ Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
   My heart with His peace did abound;
   In Him the rich blessing I found,
   Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.	- Peace

4. In Jesus for peace I abide,
   And as I keep close to His side;
   There's nothing but peace doth betide,
   Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.	- Peace
