Song 36
1. I heard an old old story,
   Before the world began, in glory;
   Christ Jesus died, and gave His life
   To save a wretch like me;
   I heard about His groaning,
   Of His precious blood's atoning;
   Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.

   \tO victory in Christ Jesus, my Redeemer forever,
   \tHe sought me and He bought me
   \tWith His redeeming blood.
   \tHe loved me ere I knew Him,
   \tAnd all my love is due Him.
   \tHe plunged me to victory,
   \tBeneath the cleansing blood.

2. I heard about His healing,
   Of His cleansing power revealing;
   How He made the lame to walk again
   And caused the blind to see;
   And then I cried: 'Dear Jesus,
   Come and heal my broken spirit'.
   And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.

3. I heard about a mansion
   He has built for me in glory,
   And I heard about the streets of gold
   Beyond the crystal sea;
   About the angels singing,
   And the old redemption story,
   And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory.
