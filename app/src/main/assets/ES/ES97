Song 97
   \tThere's a gospel to tell to the nations,
   \tA gospel an everlasting gospel;
   \tThere's a gospel to tell to the nations:

1. Fear God, fear God,
   For the hour of His judgement has come - 2
   And give glory, glory, glory,
   Give glory.... Glory to God! - There's

2. Believe, believe,
   And flee from the wrath that's to come - 2
   And praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
   Oh praise Him.... Give praise to God!	- There's

3. One God, one God,
   Who created the heaven and the earth - 2
   And worship, worship, worship,
   Oh worship.... Worship one God!		- There's
