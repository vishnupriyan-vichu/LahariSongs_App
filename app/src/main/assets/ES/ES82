Song 82
1. Rise ye children of redemption,
   All who cleave to Christ the head;
   Wake, arise! O mighty nation,
   Ere the foe on Zion tread.

   \tPour it forth a mighty anthem - 2
   \tLike the thunders of the sea;
   \tThrough the blood of the Lamb our ransom,
   \tMore than conquerors are we - 3
   \tThrough the blood of the Lamb our ransom,
   \tMore than conquerors are we.

2. Saints and heroes long before us
   Firmly on this ground have stood;
   See their Banners waving over us,
   Conquerors through the blood of the Lamb. - Pour it

3. Deathless, we are all unfearing,
   Life laid up with Christ have we;
   The glad morn of His appearing,
   Brought us to the living Tree. - Pour it

4. Soon we changed shall rise up with Him,
   Christ our living glorious Lord;
   Soon in joy and light adore Him,
   He our goal and our reward. - Pour it
