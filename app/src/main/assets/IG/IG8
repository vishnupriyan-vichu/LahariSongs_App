8. Song of my heart!
Chorus I :           Lord, hear this song of my heart
                             All what I've done in the past
                             You know the end from the start
                             But I wanna tell you my part

Sub Chorus :       I have no hope everything is dark 
                              My mind is roaming everywhere - even 
                              grace at times seems so far away 
                              I always do what I feel is right 
                              Even though 
                              if it should be spoiling my life - every 
                              day I'm feeling so far from you 

Chorus II :           My life is so dark - in spite 
                              I say that I know the light 

Stanza I :             Many times I felt, I was falling - so 
                              many times I found myself kneeling 
                              Sometimes I know I was crying - but 
                              Then I thought it wasn't worth the trying 
                              Lord, you know my all 
                              My body, soul and spirit heart and mind 
                              Everyday, every night 
                              Your love is crushing me, 
                              Can I see or can I feel you, 
                              in this world you've put me in,
                              I can't bear this anymore 
                              I'm close to being too far away
                              Lord, I'm close to being too far away.... 

SubChous II :      You know I question my heart many times 
                              Why do I do what I do even if I know 
                              there is no reason to pretend 
                              You look at me and know my 
                              everything, but even after knowing 
                              don't do anything, 
                              Seeing all you call me your own 

Chorus III :          I think in this world "What am I?" 
                              I learn that I'm just a passer-by. 

Stanza II :           As I was so stuck in dreaming 
                             I heard your voice that was pleading 
                             I was the cause of your crying 
                             But such a one was I had no feeling. 
                             Lord, in your love, 
                             You gave for me yourself a sacrifice 
                             Where can I see, where can I find 
                             Such love you're showing me 
                             Now when I see you, now when I feel you 
                             Only you can stop my tears 
                             I can't leave you anymore - I'm 
                             not scared of anything - 
                             But I'm scared of losing you.... 

Sub Chorus III :  You said that you will never'
                              leave me alone, you never ever left 
                              my side - even if I never lived
                              a life pleasing you, 
                              You said that I will live forever 
                              like you who are ever and ever eternal 
                              I ever since have no need to die... 

Sub Chorus IV :  You said that you have got a place for me 
                              A place no one's heard about 
                              A place made by no human hands 
                              You said that you have given me a body 
                              with that I can abide in you forever 
                              Forget'n about this dream I'm living in 

Sub Choris V :     You said that you have purified 
                               me in your love 
                               Now take me far above 
                               Give me peace more than my 
                               understanding 
                               You said that you will show the 
                               sign with your eve, the coming time to fly 
                               ever since I have no need to cry.
