5. Search me O God

Search me O God, and know my heart today;
Try me O Saviour, and know my thoughts I pray;  
See if there be some wicked ways in me;  
Cleanse me from every sin and set me free.

I praise thee Lord, for cleansing me from sin;
Fulfil thy word and, make me pure within;
Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame;
Grant my desire to magnify Thy Name.

Lord take my life, and make it wholly thine;
Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
I now surrender Lord in Thee abide.
