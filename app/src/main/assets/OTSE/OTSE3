3. O! what a wonderful

O! what a wonderful, wonderful day,
Day I will never forget 
After I'd wandered in darkness away, 
Jesus my Saviour I met.
O! what a tender, compassionate friend, 
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart! 

Chorus: Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
             When at the cross the Saviour made me whole!
             My sins were washed away,
             And my night was turned to-day
             Heaven came down and glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine 
Justified fully thro 'Calvary's love, 
O what a standing is mine! 
And the transaction so quickly was made, 
When as a sinner I came, 
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer,
He saved me, O praise His dear name !


Now I've a hope that will surely endure 
After the passing of time 
I have a future in heaven for sure, 
There in those mansions sublime; 
And it's because of that wonderful day 
When at the cross I believed, 
Riches eternal and blessings supernal 
From His precious hand I received

God has descended on moon landing day 
Wonderful presence Divine 
Came down to rapture His little Bride 
Oh! what a future is mine 
And this translation so quickly will come 
Now I have taken His name 
Wonderful blessings His Triumphs afford 
Since in His fulness He came
